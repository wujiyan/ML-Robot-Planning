# ML-Robot-Planning

Starter code for the project includes the following files:

* robot.py - This script establishes the robot class. 
* robot_benchmark.py - This script eastablished benchmark robot class. 
* maze.py - This script contains functions for constructing the maze and for checking for walls upon robot movement or sensing.
* tester.py - This script will be run to test the robotâ€™s ability to navigate mazes.
* showmaze.py - This script can be used to create a visual demonstration of what a maze looks like.
* test_maze_##.txt - These files provide three sample mazes upon which to test your robot. Feel free to create your own mazes using the specifications above.
* proposal.pdf - Proposal for this project
* final report.pdf - The final report for this project

To run the tester, you can do so from the command line with a command like the following: python tester.py test_maze_01.txt. You should perform no modifications to maze.py or tester.py; the script you should be modifying is robot.py. If you create additional scripts, make sure that you include them in your submission.
The maze visualization follows a similar syntax, e.g. python showmaze.py test_maze_01.txt. The script uses the turtle module to visualize the maze; you can click on the window with the visualization after drawing is complete to close the window. You are free to modify showmaze.py, but it will not be used or looked at in evaluation of your project.
To see the results for benchmark robot, one quick way is to change the heading of tester.py.
